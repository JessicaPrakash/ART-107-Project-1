<h1 style="color:black;">Jessica Prakash</h1>

<p style="color:black;">For project 1, I focused on using the symbolism of butterflies flying in a new land to demonstrate the impact of finally finding peace after entering a dream-like world that many have 
searched for all their lives. A Land Far Away signifies finally finding freedom in a new land, living a better life and moving forward. In nature, many animals have struggled and 
lost their homes due to environmental conditions and harmful predators. This is why many of them run away and go on journeys in hope of finding a new home where they do not
experience any of their past struggles and they can live their dreams. The colorful butterflies symbolize freedom, the start of a new life and hope. On a bright day with a light 
breeze, they are flying in a new land full of trees and flowers away from past struggles, pain and predators. They are free to wander their new home and live their dream lives. 
The open field of grass, trees, flowers and bright blue sky allow them to explore new horizons, be care free and have peace. A Land Far Away uses these butterflies
and the land they found to portray the beauty of escaping struggles, living dreams and entering a new place to call home.
